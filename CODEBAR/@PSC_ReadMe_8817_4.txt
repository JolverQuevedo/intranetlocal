Title: Pure ASP Barcode Generator Version 2
Description: Generates an barcode in ASP without any com+ components or groups of images.
Currently supports the following code types: UPC-A, code39, code128b, ean-13, postnet, planet.
Also now supports text in the barcode image (which is why I'm reposting this as V2. I've had about 100 requests for font support.). Currently has 10px & 12px Courier New fonts, but new fonts are easy to import with the provided script.
